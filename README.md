Engineering Undergrad @ the National University of Singapore.

Currently pursuing a double major in Mechanical Engineering && Computer Science.
Intending to specialize in Robotics (Engineering side) && Artifical Intelligence (Computing side).

Mostly interested in appleOS platform-native app development, operating systems engineering,
computer/software security, cyber-security architecture, embedded programming, machine learning,
automation systems, shell/apple scripting and unix/unix-like sysadmin stuff.

Also interested in engineering design & modelling, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics,
quantum mechanics, spacecraft dynamics and control, astrophysics and occasionally, existential philosophy
and constitutional law. Stay tuned.

I'm new to GitHub so I'm currently in the midst of uploading and archiving some of my old (and current)
works and projects here, more stuff on the way.
